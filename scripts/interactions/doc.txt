Interation System

The classes in this directory define the interactions between decoupled objects in the game.

Each class corresponds to a function which can be called on something, with an instance of the class as the only argument.

Example:
	obj.place(Place.new(/* args */)) 
tells the object to place itself using the supplied arguments.

Duck typing is used to define/find the interaction functions (like place() above). Use has_method() if you're not sure if the thing you're interacting with supports the interaction.

Example:
	if obj.has_method("place"):
		// obj supports placing so do it
		obj.place(Place.new(/* args */))
	else:
		// default behaviour if necessary...

Over simple duck typing, this system provides better documentation of the arguments to each interaction (based on class content) and easier mainainence/catching of bugs, using the argument class.
